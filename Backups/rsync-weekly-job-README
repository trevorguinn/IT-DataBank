#  Weekly Rsync Backup Script

This script automates a weekly backup of the `/home` directory using `rsync`, logging all activity and errors. It is intended for use in Linux environments where automated, versioned backups are part of routine operational procedures.

---

##  Features
- Uses `rsync` with archive and human-readable flags (`-avh`)
- Deletes destination files that no longer exist at the source (`--delete`)
- Logs all actions to `/var/log/rsync-backup.log`
- Creates a new backup folder named with the current date: `home-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Basic error handling and log protection

---

##  Script Location
