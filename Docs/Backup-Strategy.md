| Access Control     | Least privilege on backup storage             |
| Physical Security  | Locked server/NAS room, offsite encrypted HDD |
| Ransomware Defense | Immutable snapshots (where supported)         |



## Retention & Rotation Policy

Use GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) rotation:

Daily (Son) backups: Keep 7 days

Weekly (Father) backups: Keep 4 weeks

Monthly (Grandfather): Keep 6 months

Archive critical systems to cold storage annually (external drive stored offsite)


## Recovery Testing Schedule

| Test Type             | Frequency  | Responsible |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| File-level Restore    | Monthly    | Help Desk   |
