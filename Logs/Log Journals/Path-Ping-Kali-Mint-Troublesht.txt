Issue: Kali and Mint VMs Unable to Ping or Connect



Overview:

VMs on internal LabNet were unable to communicate, resulting in Destination Host Unreachable errors and failed log forwarding between Kali Linux and Linux Mint.

Initial Observations:

Both VMs had dual network adapters:

Adapter 1: Internal Network (LabNet)

Adapter 2: NAT (for internet access)

Troubleshooting Steps:

Step 1: Confirm VM Network Settings

Verified that both Kali and Mint VM network adapters were configured correctly:

Adapter 1: Internal Network, name: LabNet, Cable Connected: ✔️

Adapter 2: NAT

Step 2: Check VM IP Configurations

Kali:

ip a
# eth1: 192.168.56.11/24 (Internal)
# eth0: 10.x.x.x/24 (NAT)

Mint:

ip a
# enp0s3: 192.168.56.20/24 (Internal)
# enp0s8: 10.0.2.15/24 (NAT)

Step 3: Identify Routing Issue

Both VMs routed traffic by default through their NAT adapters, causing internal traffic to fail.

Step 4: Apply Static Routing Fix

Kali (send internal traffic through internal adapter):

sudo ip route add 192.168.56.0/24 dev eth1

Mint (send internal traffic through internal adapter):

sudo ip route add 192.168.56.0/24 dev enp0s3

Step 5: Verify Connectivity

From Kali:

ping 192.168.56.20
# Successful reply received

From Mint:

ping 192.168.56.11
# Successful reply received

Resolution:

The manual static routes resolved the internal connectivity issue, enabling successful communication between Kali and Mint VMs on LabNet.

Follow-Up:

Continued log forwarding configuration via rsyslog from Kali to Mint.

Monitored and confirmed successful log receipt on Mint syslog server.
