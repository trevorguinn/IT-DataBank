# LabNet Troubleshooting Logbook

This document tracks real issues encountered in my home lab and how they were diagnosed and resolved. It demonstrates a methodical approach to troubleshooting, similar to real help desk or sysadmin environments.

###  Issue 1: NAT Adapter Error – "No NAT network name is currently specified"

**Symptoms:**
- VM unable to connect to the internet after adding NAT adapter
- VirtualBox error message when starting VM

**Diagnosis:**
- Checked Network settings → Adapter 2 (NAT) was enabled, but dropdown was empty
- Verified NAT network had not been created in VirtualBox preferences

**Fix:**
1. Opened VirtualBox > File > Network > NAT Networks
2. Created new NAT network: `LabNet-NAT`
3. Reattached it to VM → NAT connection successful

 **Resolved:** VM had internet access via NAT when needed

###  Issue 2: `sudo apt update` failed – "Public key is not available"

**Symptoms:**
- Ubuntu server failed to update
- Error: `The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available`

**Diagnosis:**
- Looked up missing key ID from the error message
- Confirmed it was a third-party repo missing its signing key

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <KEYID>
sudo apt update


Issue 3: Syslog Not Receiving Remote Logs

##Symptoms:

Central Ubuntu server not receiving logs from other lab VMs

Configured /etc/rsyslog.conf, but no logs showed in /var/log/syslog

## Diagnosis:

Confirmed rsyslog service was not installed or enabled

Port 514 was not open or listening

Incorrect remote logger config on client

# Fix:

Installed rsyslog:
sudo apt install rsyslog
Enabled UDP reception in /etc/rsyslog.conf:

module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")

Restarted service:

sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
Used logger from client to test:


logger "Test message from lab-win10"

Resolved: Centralized logs confirmed from multiple devices



## Tools Used
VirtualBox network manager

PowerShell & Bash commands

SSH for remote log checks

/etc/hosts, Wireshark, ping, and trace
